<p style="font-size:20px"><b>Titan Entry Descent & Landing (EDL) Mission Design</b></p>
<hr>
</center>
<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Project Description:</b><br><br>&emsp;This EDL mission design is the final project associated with the course ASTE 577: Entry, Descent, & Landing for Planetary Surface Exploration, taught at USC by Dr. Anita Sengupta. The proposed mission involves sending an unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV) to the liquid methane sea, Kraken Mare, on Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is the only celestial body in our solar system other than Earth to have bodies of liquid on its surface. As such, its hydrocarbon seas have become a target of investigation for scientists. It is hypothesized these lakes may support life similar to that found near Earth's deep sea hydrothermal vents.<br>
&emsp;The presentation below is a concise visualization of the mission and the report following the presentation dives deeper into the mission requirements, EDL architecture, definition of entry and atmospheric conditions, vehicle sizing, and communication system sizing.
