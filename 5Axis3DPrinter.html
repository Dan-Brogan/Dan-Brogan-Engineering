<p style="font-size:20px"><b>5-Axis 3D Printer</b></p>

<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Project Description:</b><br><br>&emsp;The objective of the 5-axis 3D printer project is to design, build, and test a 5-axis 3D printer capable of printing complex geometries with reduced support material. After literature and patent searches, URI Mechanical Engineering capstone Team 09 began generating concepts for the mechanical, electrical, and software design. After evaluating each concept, Team 09 designed and built a 5-axis 3D printer. The mechanical design includes 3 prismatic axes (X, Y, Z), and two revolute axes (A & B). The X and Y axes use timing belts to position the Z axis mechanism, and the Z axis mechanism uses a lead screw and guide rod to position the extruder. The printing bed is a circular glass plate which can tilt (B axis) and spin (A axis) to allow for the additional two degrees of freedom. The electrical design includes a Raspberry Pi which controls stepper motor drivers to drive all 5 axes as well as the filament feeder. The Raspberry Pi is also used to enable microchips that control the temperature of the extruder and build plate. The software design includes Python which runs on the Raspberry Pi and C which is flashed onto the microchips. The tasks executed by the Raspberry Pi include motion control and a functional GUI which allows the user to load a file, preview it in 3D, jog the axes, set the temperatures, and even see a simulated representation of the part being printed in real time. The C flashed onto the microchips use proportional integral control to achieve a certain threshold around a desired temperature. Team 09 validated the motion control and temperature control through testing; however, further testing is required before a part can be printed. In conclusion, Team 09 designed and built a 5-axis 3D printer.

<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Future Work:</b><br><br>&emsp; Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Team 09 had restricted access to campus for the second half of the their final semester at URI. While the 5-axis 3D printer was designed and constructed, the necessary testing could not be completed to showcase all 5 axes being utilized to print a part. Future work should include using all 5 axes in addition to the extruder and heating bed control systems to print a part. Testing should be done to compare printing speed and material usage of a conventional 3-axis printer to the 5-axis printer under similar conditions (same nozzle diameter, jog speed, feed rate, etc.). A vertically oriented dumbbell-shaped specimen should be printed for comparison as it is a part which requires support material on a conventional 3-axis printer and would require no support material using the 5-axis printer. Additional considerations include optimizing the stability of the Z-axis mechanism as well as reducing the weight of the A and B axis cradle.
