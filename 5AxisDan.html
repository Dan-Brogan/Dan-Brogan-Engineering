<p style="font-size:20px"><b>5-Axis 3D Printer</b></p>
<hr>
</center>
<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Project Description:</b><br><br>&emsp;This project was inspired by my senior Mechanical Engineering capstone project at the University of Rhode Island. Before the COVID-19 pandemic restricted access to campus, my team had designed and constructed a 3D printer capable of following a 3-axis toolpath. While we had created a machine that is mechanically capable of 5-axis motion, a software solution to following a 5-axis toolpath was not investigated.
<br>&emsp;After graduating URI, I decided to design and build a 5-axis 3D printer using my own resources. I redesigned the mechanical, electrical, and software to create the first prototype. This prototype used a Raspberry Pi with firmware that I wrote from scratch in Python to simultaneously control each axis. I used a technique called multithreading which allows the Raspberry Pi to conduct multiple tasks at virtually the same time even though it is only a single-core processor. Regarding the mechanical design, I chose a layout that would reduce the inertial loads on the motors for 5-axis operation. The X, Y, and Z axes are prismatic like a traditional cartesian printer, and the remaining 2 axes are revolute. Revolute axis A spins the printing bed within its plane while the B axis tilts the printing bed out of plane. I created a software solution capable of interpreting 3-axis gcode for certain axisymmetric parts and converting it to 5-axis gcode to test if the prototype could follow a 5-axis toolpath.

<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>5-Axis Toolpath Demonstration:</b><br><br>&emsp;The toolpath demonstration video below shows the 5-axis toolpath for a dumbbell-shaped part. This shape was chosen for demonstration because it requires support material on a 3-axis printer and requires no support material on a 5-axis printer. The part was modelled in Autodesk Inventor and sliced using Ultimaker Cura. The 3-axis gcode from Cura was then interpreted by my software and converted to 5-axis instructions. The video shows a complete 5-axis print routine where the extruder centers over the build platform, prints the 3-axis component of the part including a substrate for when the other two axes are activated, rotates the build plate 90 degrees and begins printing in 5-axis mode.

<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Continuing Work:</b><br><br>&emsp;While the first prototype successfully demonstrated the ability to follow a 5-axis toolpath, significant work was still required. The temperature control system, extruder motor firmware, operator interface, and a 5-axis slicer still needed to be developed. In addition to this, the mechanical, electrical, and software aspects of this project could use significant renovation to improve the design for manufacturability, affordability, and user experience.
<br>&emsp;I first focused on the physical redesign with an emphasis on reducing the number of manufacturing steps required to build the printer. Each component in the design is either a COTS sourced part or it is a custom part. COTS parts are desireable because they are inexpensive, high quality, and it is likely that multiple vendors have the same part so there are no schedule hang-ups in waiting for a single company to regenerate its supply. Since 5-axis printers are not mainstream, there is no way to get around having to make some custom parts. Unlike the first prototype, every custom part on the second prototype is made from the same material and uses the same manufacturing process. The custom parts on the first prototype were either 3D printed (on a 3-axis printer) or they were manually cut from sheet metal and welded together. Wanting to reduce manufacturing complexity, the custom parts on the second prototype are all CNC-milled from 3mm thick aluminum and the parts that require bending are all bent to the same angle of 90 degrees. This design choice eliminates the large amount of manufacturing time needed to print custom parts and manually cut and weld sheet metal together.
<br>&emsp;The second prototype switched from a Raspberry Pi and CNC motor controllers to an Arduino Mega 2560, RAMPS 1.4, and A4988 stepper motor controllers. This design choice greatly reduces the cost and electronics size, increases the number of GPIO pins, and facilitates the use of an LCD display with a rotary encoder.
<br>&emsp;As this project is unique it is not feasible to repurpose publicly available firmware. As such, I wrote Arduino firmware from scratch to control the stepper motors, LCD screen and rotary encoder, and am starting work on the temperature control system.
<br>&emsp;Further details regarding the design of this project are not discussed as they are considered intellectual property to the owner of this website.
