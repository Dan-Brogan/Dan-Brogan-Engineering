<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Project Description:</b><br><br>&emsp;Space Policy Document 1 calls for the U.S. to lead commercial and international partners in returning humans to the Moon “for long-term exploration and utilization” [1]. The Moon Village Association shares this vision and adds on the importance of sharing information between these partners to facilitate cooperation [2]. This call is being answered by the NASA Artemis program, which plans to lead commercial and international partners towards establishing a sustained human presence on the Moon [3-5]. The USC CHASE initiative proposes the Robotic Remote-Sensing Scout (R2-S2) to assist lunar EVA crews for Artemis III and following crewed lunar missions. R2-S2 is a versatile robotic rover intended to dramatically reduce the risk associated with lunar EVA missions.<br>
R2-S2 has two primary modes of operation: 1) Teleoperated mode and 2) Autonomous crew-assist mode. In teleoperated mode, the lunar crew remotely operates R2-S2 from inside their lunar habitat to assess the safety of planned EVA crew missions (mission recon) or to conduct some tasks that would otherwise require a crewed EVA (remote exploration and inspection). For EVA mission recon, the teleoperator directs R2-S2 to the desired mission destination while gathering valuable sensor data that will aid in determining mission safety. In autonomous crew-assist mode, R2-S2 provides support alongside the crew during EVA excursions. In this mode, R2-S2 livestreams EVA operations to Earth, carries tools, and performs specific tasks when commanded by the crew (sample collection, telescoping, microscopy, in-situ sensor readings). R2-S2 also carries spare oxygen tanks and suit repair materials for contingency scenarios.<br>
R2-S2 comes in two configurations such that it may accommodate either equatorial or polar missions. The main differences between the two configurations are the solar panel placement, wheel width, and battery pack insulation.
R2-S2 will be a commercial and international effort led by NASA, and all data collected will be shared with those commercial and international partners. The Artemis program poses challenges and risks that have not been faced before. R2-S2 aims to help mitigate those risks as much as possible to ensure the safety of the crew and facilitate productivity on the lunar surface.<br>
The presentation below outlines the R2-S2 concept and was presented to a board of reviewers including the highly esteemed Buzz Aldrin.<br>
