<p style="font-size:20px"><b>NASA Venus Rover Mechanical Sensors</b></p>

<p style="font-size:20px">&emsp;<b>Project Description:</b><br>&emsp;Venus is Earth's intruiguing sister planet, the second planet from the Sun. According to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/automaton-rover-for-extreme-environments-aree/">NASA</a>, Venus hosts extreme environmental conditions with a surface temperature of 450&deg;C and surface pressure of 92 bar. Due to these extreme conditions, even military grade electronics fail quickly on its surface. The longest lasting Venus rovers only lasted 23 to 127 minutes on the surface of Venus before their electronics failed and they became unoperational. To circumvent this challenge, NASA plans to make an automaton rover; one that moves under its own mechanical power without the use of electronics. This presents a need to develop purely mechanical sensors for obstacle avoidance. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory opened the "Exploring Hell: Avoiding Obstacles on a Clockwork Rover" challenge on <a href="https://www.herox.com/VenusRover">HeroX.com</a> for the public to solve. The sibling duo Dan and Mitchell Brogan worked together to develop and perform a preliminary analysis of sensor concepts for NASA's challenge. Below is our report which we submitted to NASA before the challenge closed on May 29, 2020.
